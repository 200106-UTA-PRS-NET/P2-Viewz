# Viewz
## Synopsis
Our team will be providing a service that takes markdown as input and generates a Wiki on output.
We will be consuming the Github markdown API.
This gives us the ability to take in at most 400KB per page which is perfect for what we are trying to do with this.
We will be using the MVC Framework for our interface and communication to and from our API.
Postman will be used to test our API functionality.
We have already set up CI to publish our application on Azure.
